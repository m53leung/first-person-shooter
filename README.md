# first-person-shooter
I developed this game using the eclipse IDE for a project in my high school computer science course. I used java.awt and a game loop method I found online. The project was
created by my classmate Amir Salar, and myself. My partner wrote the code for the Mainmenu.java and instructions.java class, while I wrote the rest of the code
(except for the game loop method I mentioned). If you wish to play the game, you must download and run GunnerZ_Final.jar. The code can be viewed in first-person-shooter/src
